      <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
      <p>        While doing the dragon project, I learned that I needed to retain more information. I was able to look back at the material and use examples to create my code, but it was definitely a struggle. I was tab-hopping back and forth to ensure edits were working and the correct elements were altered. Although I needed help finding how to combine java scripts in the same file, I had to make two separate javascript files. From reading, using two files increases the load time of the site.</p>
      <p>Issues that were pointed out in my project were that the faq page did not have to drop down tabs, my background/title needed to be showing up, and the text within the widget needed to be bigger. I had to correct the background and title section of the site because it was essentially blank. Also, I did take into consideration the faq page. I like the drop-down boxes' look over a straightforward presentation of the question-and-answer material. Lastly, I increased the size of the widget section. All of these changes, in my opinion, added value to this site. 
      </p>
    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
      <p> Progressive enhancement is all about the focus of basic content and functionality of the webpage to allow everyone to have access to the content while other users that can afford it, can have the advanced features. The main focus is the pages' text using html, followed by the CSS, and lastly the enhancements provided by JavaScript.  Progressive enhancement is important because the focus of the website should be focused on compatibility for every user. Meeting the needs of any user can help the traffic of the website instead of losing a user do to inability to access the site.
